<p style="font-size:120%;">A 2020 black comedy-drama film directed by Thomas Vinterberg. Teachers Martin, Tommy, Peter, and Nikolaj struggle
  with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and stale. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 
  40th birthday, the group begins to discuss the theory of psychiatrist Finn Skårderud — that humans are born with a

  decide to embark on an experiment to test Skårderud's theory.</p>
