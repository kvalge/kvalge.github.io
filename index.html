          alt="General Magic">
        <p style="color:gray;"></b>A 2018 documentary of how a great vision and an epic failure changed the lives of billions. The ideas that dominate 
          the tech industry and our day to day lives were born at a secretive Silicon Valley start-up named 'General Magic', which
          spun out of Apple in 1990 to create the first handheld personal communicator (or "smartphone").</p>

          alt="Lost in Translation">
        <p style="color:gray;"></b>A 2003 romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Bob Harris, a fading American movie star
          who is having a midlife crisis when he travels to Tokyo to promote Suntory whisky. There, he befriends another estranged 
          American named Charlotte, a young woman and recent college graduate. The film explores themes of alienation and 
          disconnection against a backdrop of cultural displacement in Japan.</p>

          alt="Another round">
        <p style="color:gray;">A 2020 black comedy-drama film directed by Thomas Vinterberg. Teachers Martin, Tommy, Peter, and Nikolaj struggle
          with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and stale. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 
          40th birthday, the group begins to discuss the theory of psychiatrist Finn Skårderud — that humans are born with a 
          blood alcohol content (BAC) deficiency of 0.05%, and that being at 0.05% makes one more creative and relaxed. The friends
          decide to embark on an experiment to test Skårderud's theory.</p>
